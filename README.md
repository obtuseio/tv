# tv.obtuse.io

This repository contains the complete source code that powers https://tv.obtuse.io.

## Architecture

The code in this repository is split into two parts: `back` and `front`.

`back` is a Rust project which downloads IMDb's official dataset from https://datasets.imdbws.com/, parses this data, and generates a JSON index of all TV Series and an episode list file for each TV series.

`front` is an Elm project which reads the data generated by `back` and generates charts and tables for each series as visible on https://tv.obtuse.io.

## Running

From `back`, run `cargo run --release` to download the IMDb datasets and generate JSON files.

From `front`, run `yarn install` and `yarn start` to run the application on http://localhost:4000.
